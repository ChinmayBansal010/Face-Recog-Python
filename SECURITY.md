# Security Policy

## Introduction
This project implements a Face Recognition Attendance System using Python. Given the sensitive nature of biometric data, we are committed to ensuring that the software is secure, and that any vulnerabilities are promptly addressed.

Supported Versions
We ensure that the following versions of the project are actively supported and monitored for security issues:

v1.1.0: Actively maintained and supported.
v0.0.0: No longer supported but critical security patches will be considered.
Data Privacy and Security
Biometric Data Handling:

Biometric data (face images) are securely stored and encrypted. No biometric data is shared with third-party services.
We recommend using strong encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256) to store any captured images or facial feature data.
Access Control:

Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive biometric data.
Strong password policies are enforced for user accounts, including a minimum password length and complexity requirements.
Access to the system should be logged, including login attempts, modifications to user data, and attendance log entries.
Data Encryption:

All data transmission (both to and from the system) should use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS) to avoid interception.
Ensure all databases are secured with encryption-at-rest mechanisms.
System Updates:

Regularly update Python libraries and dependencies to the latest secure versions.
Apply patches for any reported vulnerabilities in the face recognition libraries or related software components.
Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities in the Face Recognition Attendance System, we encourage responsible disclosure.

Please follow these steps to report:

Contact: Report the issue via email to [your_email@example.com]. Do not open an issue or a pull request with sensitive details.
Description: Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it, potential impact, and possible fixes.
Response Time: We aim to respond to all security-related inquiries within 48 hours and will work to resolve critical issues as quickly as possible.
Security Best Practices
We recommend the following best practices for securing your own instances of this software:

Regularly update all dependencies.
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing the system.
Monitor for unusual or unauthorized access attempts.
Perform regular security audits of the system, database, and network configurations.
External Libraries
This project makes use of external libraries such as dlib and face_recognition. We advise reviewing their individual security policies and regularly checking for updates or patches related to their usage.

Conclusion
The security of our users and their data is paramount. We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of security and privacy for the Face Recognition Attendance System.
